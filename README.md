# RubblApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.2.0.

I chose Angular over React.js because:

I wanted to use the template approach of Angular instead of the using JSX in React.js. 
I wanted to have css modules and I didnt want to eject React.js app and add the hashing.
These things will be easier for desingers to work with the HTML/CSS in the future.
I wanted to use Angular's approach to using services.
I wanted to use the Angular CLI to generate components..( ok a little lazy ) but it does generate test scripts to build out later. :)

This project using a modified version of Bootstrap css. 

Coding Exercise:
1. Navigate to https://www.designspiration.net/
2. Perform a search and notice how suggestions look:

3. Make a website that mirrors this functionality. The website should have:
a. A title at the top
b. A search bar with the same effects shown
c. A single row of images underneath (the blue, gray, and blue to purple gradient one) so
you can see the fade effect
d. Don’t worry about signup, login, or any other functionality
4. For the search suggestions, use the following dictionary
a. Random
b. Real

5. It should simulate like you are hitting an API that returns JSON, but doesn’t
actually build an API or anything.
